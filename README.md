# Optimizing Career Paths: A Decision Tree Approach
## Project Overview
This project presents a decision analysis framework to help a Bachelor of Commerce (Honors) graduate evaluate career choices. The analysis considers uncertainties, objectives, 
and potential outcomes to provide a structured recommendation. The framework employs decision trees, influence diagrams, and sensitivity analysis to arrive at an optimal decision.

## Problem Statement
Vyshu, a third-year undergraduate student, is at a crucial juncture in her academic and professional journey. She must decide whether to:
1. Pursue higher education (MBA, M.Com, or study abroad).
2. Enter the job market directly. This decision will significantly impact her future career trajectory, earnings, and personal satisfaction.

## Decisions to Make
The primary decisions to address are:
1. Higher Education vs. Job:
Should Vyshu continue her studies or enter the workforce immediately?
2. India vs. Abroad:
If pursuing higher education, should she study in India or abroad (e.g., USA, Canada, UK)?
3. Program Selection:
If studying in India, should she pursue an MBA or M.Com program?
4. Funding Options:
What financial sources should she rely on—loans, personal funds, or other resources?
5. Job Prospects:
If entering the job market, what are the opportunities, industries, and regions with the best potential outcomes?

## Objectives
The primary goals of the analysis are to:
1) Optimize potential salary and financial stability.
2) Identify the best job market opportunities.
3) Enhance quality of life by balancing personal and professional aspirations.

## Uncertainties
The analysis incorporates several uncertainties that could impact the outcomes:
1. Higher Education vs. Job Market:
Will pursuing higher education lead to better job opportunities or higher salaries?
Is the current job market favorable for fresh graduates?
2. Country of Study:
Will studying abroad provide a significant career advantage over studying in India?
How will geopolitical or economic conditions in countries like the USA, Canada, or the UK affect career prospects?
3. Funding:
Can Vyshu secure a loan, or will she need to rely on personal funds?
What is the financial burden of pursuing higher education in India versus abroad?
4. Job Availability:
If Vyshu enters the job market immediately, what are the chances of securing a position aligned with her career goals?
Will she face prolonged unemployment or underemployment?
5. Program Choice:
Between an MBA and M.Com in India, which program offers better returns in terms of skills and salary?
How competitive are the admissions for her desired program?

## Methodology
The analysis is conducted using a systematic approach:
1. Defining Objectives and Uncertainties: Key factors such as funding, job availability, and program selection are outlined.
2. Influence Diagram: A visual representation of the dependencies and relationships between decision elements.
3. Decision Tree Analysis: Structured pathways that map out potential outcomes, probabilities, and weighted decisions.
4. Sensitivity Analysis: Testing the impact of varying assumptions to assess decision robustness.

## Influence Diagram

The influence diagram illustrates the key factors affecting the decision:
1. Decision Nodes: Choices between higher education and employment, selection of the country, and funding sources.
2. Chance Nodes: Probabilities associated with job opportunities, financial availability, and program outcomes.
3. Outcome Nodes: The impact of decisions on salary, job satisfaction, and career growth.

## Decision Nodes
Key decision points include:
1. Higher Education vs. Job in India: Deciding between pursuing higher education and entering the workforce immediately.
2. India vs. Abroad: If higher education is chosen, selecting the location (India, USA, Canada, or UK).
3. Program Selection: For higher education in India, deciding between MBA and M.Com programs.
4. Funding Options: Choosing between loans and personal savings to finance education.
5. Job Market: Evaluating job prospects and salary expectations across different locations and programs.
